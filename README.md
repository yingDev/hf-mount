Mount [Hugging Face Buckets](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/storage-buckets) and repos as local filesystems. No download, no copy, no waiting.

```bash
hf-mount start bucket myuser/my-bucket /tmp/data
```

Also works with any model or dataset repo (read-only):

```bash
hf-mount start repo openai/gpt-oss-20b /tmp/gpt-oss
```

Commands will pick up your `HF_TOKEN` from the environment, or you can pass it explicitly with `--hf-token`.

Then use your local folders as usual:
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("/tmp/gpt-oss")  # reads on demand, no download step
```

hf-mount exposes [Hugging Face Buckets](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/storage-buckets) and [Hub repos](https://huggingface.co) as a local filesystem via FUSE or NFS. Files are fetched lazily on first read, so only the bytes your code actually touches ever hit the network.

Two backends are available:
- **NFS** (recommended) -- works everywhere, no root, no kernel extension
- **FUSE** -- tighter kernel integration, requires root or [macFUSE](https://osxfuse.github.io/) on macOS

Agentic storage: Agents don't require complex APIs or SDKs, they thrive on the filesystem: ls, cat, find, grep, and the power of composable UNIX pipelines.

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS, Linux)

```bash
brew install hf-mount
```

On macOS, this installs the NFS backend only (`hf-mount`, `hf-mount-nfs`). For the FUSE backend on macOS, download the binary manually or build from source — macFUSE is closed-source and not distributable through homebrew-core.

### Manual download

Binaries are available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/huggingface/hf-mount/releases):

| Platform | Daemon | NFS | FUSE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux x86_64 | `hf-mount-x86_64-linux` | `hf-mount-nfs-x86_64-linux` | `hf-mount-fuse-x86_64-linux` |
| Linux aarch64 | `hf-mount-aarch64-linux` | `hf-mount-nfs-aarch64-linux` | `hf-mount-fuse-aarch64-linux` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `hf-mount-arm64-apple-darwin` | `hf-mount-nfs-arm64-apple-darwin` | `hf-mount-fuse-arm64-apple-darwin` |

### System dependencies (FUSE only)

The NFS backend has no system dependencies. For FUSE:

**Linux**: `sudo apt-get install -y fuse3` (pre-built binaries only need the runtime; building from source also requires `libfuse3-dev`)

**macOS**: install [macFUSE](https://osxfuse.github.io/) (`brew install macfuse`, requires reboot on first install)

### Build from source

Requires Rust 1.89+.

```bash
# NFS only (no system deps, works everywhere)
cargo build --release --features nfs

# FUSE (requires macFUSE on macOS, fuse3 on Linux)
cargo build --release --features fuse

# All backends
cargo build --release --features fuse,nfs
```

Binaries: `target/release/hf-mount`, `target/release/hf-mount-nfs`, `target/release/hf-mount-fuse`

## Best for / Not for

**Best for:**
- Loading models and datasets without downloading the full repo
- Browsing repo contents (`ls`, `cat`, `find`) without cloning
- Read-heavy ML workloads (training, inference, evaluation)
- Environments where disk space is limited

**Not for:**
- General-purpose networked filesystem (no multi-writer support, no cross-node file locking)
- Latency-sensitive random I/O (first reads require network round-trips)
- Workloads that need strong consistency (files can be stale for up to 10 s)
- Heavy concurrent writes from multiple mounts (last writer wins, no conflict detection)
- Editing files with text editors in default (streaming) mode (use `--advanced-writes`)

Advisory file locks (`flock`, `fcntl` POSIX record locks) are supported locally on a single mount on both backends — enough for Python `filelock`, `huggingface_hub`, `datasets`, and similar cache-coordination use cases within one machine. They are not coordinated across multiple clients.

See [Consistency model](#consistency-model) for details.

## Usage

### Mount a repo (read-only)

```bash
# Public model (no token needed)
hf-mount start repo openai/gpt-oss-20b /tmp/model

# Private model
hf-mount start --hf-token $HF_TOKEN repo myorg/my-private-model /tmp/model

# Dataset
hf-mount start repo datasets/open-index/hacker-news /tmp/hn

# Specific revision
hf-mount start repo openai-community/gpt2 /tmp/gpt2 --revision v1.0

# Subfolder only
hf-mount start repo openai-community/gpt2/onnx /tmp/onnx
```

### Mount a Bucket (read-write)

[Buckets](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/storage-buckets) are S3-like object storage on the Hub, designed for large-scale mutable data (training checkpoints, logs, artifacts) without git version control.

```bash
hf-mount start --hf-token $HF_TOKEN bucket myuser/my-bucket /tmp/data

# Read-only
hf-mount start --hf-token $HF_TOKEN --read-only bucket myuser/my-bucket /tmp/data

# Subfolder only
hf-mount start --hf-token $HF_TOKEN bucket myuser/my-bucket/checkpoints /tmp/ckpts
```

### Manage mounts

```bash
hf-mount status                  # list running mounts
hf-mount stop /tmp/data          # stop and unmount
```

Logs are written to `~/.hf-mount/logs/`. PID files are stored in `~/.hf-mount/pids/`.

### FUSE backend

By default, `hf-mount` uses NFS. Pass `--fuse` for tighter kernel integration (page cache invalidation, per-file metadata revalidation). Requires `fuse3` on Linux or [macFUSE](https://osxfuse.github.io/) on macOS.

```bash
hf-mount start --fuse --hf-token $HF_TOKEN bucket myuser/my-bucket /mnt/data
```

### Foreground mode

For scripts, containers, or debugging, use the backend binaries directly (they run in the foreground):

```bash
hf-mount-nfs repo gpt2 /tmp/gpt2
hf-mount-fuse --hf-token $HF_TOKEN bucket myuser/my-bucket /mnt/data
```

### macOS: launch as a daemon with launchd

To have `hf-mount` start automatically on login, create a LaunchAgent:

```bash
label=co.huggingface.hf-mount

mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents

cat > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/$label.plist <<EOF
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

    <string>$label</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>

        <string>repo</string>
        <string>openai/gpt-oss-20b</string>

    <string>/tmp/hf-mount.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
EOF

launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/$label.plist
```

To stop: `launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/$label.plist`

### Unmount

```bash
umount /tmp/data                 # NFS or FUSE (macOS)
fusermount -u /tmp/data          # FUSE (Linux)
hf-mount stop /tmp/data          # daemon mounts
```

### Bounding inode memory

Under workloads that enumerate large trees (a `find`, a documentation scraper, `du -sh`), the in-memory inode table can grow without bound: every path the kernel ever looked up stays resident. With `--inode-soft-limit N` set, two evictors cooperate to keep the table near `N`:

1. **Insert-time evictor** (synchronous): before adding a new entry when `len() >= N + 256`, drop the oldest-touched file/symlink/leaf-directory entries.
   - *Polite mode*: only entries the kernel has already released (`forget`-ed). Safe, no FUSE races.
   - *Force mode*: when above `2 × N` and polite found nothing, drop entries even if the kernel still caches the dentry. A racing kernel op sees ENOENT and re-looks up. **Dirty files, locally-created dirs/symlinks, and inodes with live file handles are never dropped** — the force path preserves all user data.
2. **Background LRU sweep** (every `--lru-sweep-interval-ms`): for inodes the kernel has cached but our table doesn't want, send `FUSE_NOTIFY_INVAL_ENTRY` so the kernel drops its dentry and sends us `forget`. Bounded to 1024 invalidations per sweep with EAGAIN backoff so we don't flood the notify channel.

Tuning: pick `N` below what a full-tree enumeration of your bucket would produce. For `hf-doc-build/doc-dev` with ~20k files, `--inode-soft-limit 10000` keeps sidecar RSS ~250 MiB with a 1 GiB cgroup cap.

### Logging

```bash
RUST_LOG=hf_mount=debug hf-mount-fuse repo gpt2 /mnt/gpt2
```

## Features

- **FUSE & NFS backends** -- FUSE for standard Linux/macOS, NFS for environments without `/dev/fuse`
- **Lazy loading** -- files are fetched on demand, not eagerly downloaded
- **Subfolder mounting** -- mount only a subdirectory (e.g. `user/model/ckpt/v2`)
- **Simple writes** (default) -- append-only, in-memory, synchronous upload on close
- **Advanced writes** (`--advanced-writes`) -- staging files on disk, random writes + seek, async debounced flush
- **Remote sync** -- background polling detects remote changes and updates the local view
- **POSIX metadata** -- chmod, chown, timestamps, symlinks (in-memory only, lost on unmount)

## Consistency model

hf-mount provides **eventual consistency** with remote changes. There is no push notification from the Hub; all freshness relies on client-side polling.

### Reads

Files can be stale for up to `--metadata-ttl-ms` (default 10 s) after a remote update. Two mechanisms detect changes:

1. **Metadata revalidation** (FUSE only) -- when the per-file TTL expires, the next access checks the Hub. If the file changed, cached data is invalidated.
2. **Background polling** (default every 30 s) -- lists the full tree and detects additions, modifications, and deletions.

### Writes

| | Streaming (default) | Advanced (`--advanced-writes`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Write pattern | Append-only (sequential) | Random writes, seek, overwrite |
| Storage | In-memory buffer | Local staging file on disk |
| Modify existing files | Overwrite only (O_TRUNC) | Yes (downloads file first) |
| Durability | On close | Async, debounced (2 s / 30 s max) |
| Disk space needed | None | Full file size per open file |

**Streaming mode** buffers writes in memory and uploads on `close()`. A crash before close means data loss.

> **Note:** Streaming mode does not support text editors (vim, nano, emacs). Editors that use
> unlink+create save patterns will be blocked (`EPERM`) to prevent data loss.
> Use `--advanced-writes` for interactive editing.

**Advanced mode** downloads the full file to local disk before allowing edits. After `close()`, dirty files are flushed asynchronously. A crash before flush completes means data loss.

### FUSE vs NFS

| | FUSE | NFS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metadata revalidation | Per-file, within TTL | No (NFS uses file handles) |
| Page cache invalidation | Supported | Not supported by NFS protocol |
| Staleness window | ~10 s | Up to poll interval (30 s) |
| Write mode | Streaming by default | Advanced always |

## How it works

hf-mount sits between your application and the Hugging Face Hub. It presents a standard filesystem interface (FUSE or NFS) and translates file operations into Hub API calls and storage fetches.

Reads go through an adaptive prefetch buffer that starts small and grows with sequential access. Writes are uploaded to HF storage and committed via the Hub API. A background poll loop keeps the local view in sync with remote changes.

Built on [xet-core](https://github.com/huggingface/xet-core) for content-addressed storage and efficient file transfers, and [fuser](https://github.com/cberner/fuser) for the FUSE implementation.

## Kubernetes

Use the [hf-csi-driver](https://github.com/huggingface/hf-csi-driver) to mount Buckets and repos as Kubernetes volumes. The CSI driver runs hf-mount inside a DaemonSet and exposes mounts to pods via the Container Storage Interface.

```bash
helm install hf-csi oci://ghcr.io/huggingface/charts/hf-csi-driver
```

See the [hf-csi-driver README](https://github.com/huggingface/hf-csi-driver#readme) for setup and examples.

## Testing

```bash
# Unit tests (no network, no token)
cargo test --lib --features fuse,nfs

# Integration tests (require HF_TOKEN and FUSE)
HF_TOKEN=... cargo test --release --features fuse,nfs --test fuse_ops -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture
HF_TOKEN=... cargo test --release --features fuse,nfs --test nfs_ops -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture

# Repo mount test (public repo, no token needed)
cargo test --release --features nfs --test repo_ops -- --test-threads=1 --nocapture

# Benchmarks
HF_TOKEN=... cargo test --release --features fuse,nfs --test bench -- --nocapture
```
